'''Q22 Perform the following tasks using the pandas Series object: 
    
(a) Create a Series from the list [7, 11, 13, 17].
(b) Create a Series with five elements where each element is 100. 0.
(c) Create a Series with 20 elements that are all random numbers in the range 0 to 100. Use the 
describe method to produce the Series' basic descriptive statistics.
(d) Create a Series called temperatures with the following floating-point values: 98.6, 98.9, 
100.2, and 97.9. Use the index keyword argument to specify the custom indices Julie', 
'Charlie', 'Sam', and *Andrea'. 
(e)Form a dictionary from the names and values in Part (d), then use it to initialize a Series.
