Q5. Developing a Simple College Management System in Java
Create a Java program for managing colleges and students. The provided classes model the 
relationship between colleges and students.
The College class represents a college with attributes collegeName and collegeLoc. The 
Student class represents a student with attributes studentId, studentName, and a reference
to a College object. Enhance the Student class by adding a constructor that assigns a student 
ID, name, and college information. Additionally, add a method named displayStudentInfo()
that prints the student's ID, name, and the college information in which they are enrolled.
In the Main class, instantiate at least two College objects and at least two Student objects. 
Enroll each student in one of the colleges. Then, display the information of all colleges and all 
students using the appropriate methods.


class college{
    private String collegeName;
    private String collegeLoc;

     college(String collegeName, String collegeLoc) {
        this.collegeName = collegeName;
        this.collegeLoc = collegeLoc;
    }
    public String getcllgName(){
         return collegeName;
    }
    public String getcllgLoc(){
        return collegeLoc;
    }

}
class student {
    private int studentId;
    private String studentname;

    college col;

    student(int studentId,String studentname,college col){
        this.studentId=studentId;
        this.studentname=studentname;
        this.col=col;
    }

    public void displayStudentInfo(){
        System.out.println("Id of the student is "+ studentId);
        System.out.println("Name of the student is "+studentname);
        System.out.println("college info of the student is "+ col.getcllgName() + " and " + col.getcllgLoc());
    }

}
public class AssignmentQ5 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        college c1=new college("ITER","Khandagiri");
        college c2=new college("KIIT","Patia");
        student s1=new student(101,"priyanshu",c1);
        student s2=new student(102,"puja",c2);
        s1.displayStudentInfo();
        s2.displayStudentInfo();
    }
}


//output
Id of the student is 101
Name of the student is priyanshu
college info of the student is ITER and Khandagiri
Id of the student is 102
Name of the student is puja
college info of the student is KIIT and Patia
