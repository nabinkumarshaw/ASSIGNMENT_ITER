2.	Write a Java program that demonstrates the immutability of the String class and how it implements the CharSequence interface.
Your program should illustrate the behaviours that highlight String immutability and its usage as a CharSequence.

//code
public class Q2 {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // Demonstrating String immutability
            String originalString = "Hello";
            System.out.println("Original string: " + originalString);

            String modifiedString = originalString.concat(" World");
            System.out.println("Modified string: " + modifiedString);

            System.out.println("Original string after modification: " + originalString);

            // Demonstrating usage as CharSequence
            CharSequence cs = "OpenAI";
            System.out.println("CharSequence length: " + cs.length());
            System.out.println("Char at index 2: " + cs.charAt(2));
            System.out.println("Subsequence from index 2 to 5: " + cs.subSequence(2, 5));
        }
    }

//output
Original string: Hello
Modified string: Hello World
Original string after modification: Hello
CharSequence length: 6
Char at index 2: e
Subsequence from index 2 to 5: enA
