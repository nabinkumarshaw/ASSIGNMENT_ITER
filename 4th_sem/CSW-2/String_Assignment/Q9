public class Q9 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter a sentence:");
        String sentence = sc.nextLine();
        System.out.println("Enter the word to search for:");
        String searchWord = sc.next();
        System.out.println("Enter the word to replace it with:");
        String replaceWord = sc.next();

        // Find the first occurrence of the search word in the sentence
        int index = sentence.indexOf(searchWord);

        // Replace the word using substring operations and concatenation
        String modifiedSentence = "";
        if (index != -1) {
            modifiedSentence = sentence.substring(0, index) + replaceWord + sentence.substring(index + searchWord.length());
        } else {
            modifiedSentence = sentence;
        }

        // Display the original and the modified sentences
        System.out.println("Original Sentence: " + sentence);
