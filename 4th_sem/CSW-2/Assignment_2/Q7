Q7. Consider a scenario where you are tasked with developing a simple banking application 
using Java, employing the concept of polymorphism. Your application should consist of three 
classes: Account, SavingsAccount, and CurrentAccount. The Account class serves as the 
base class with private attributes for account number and balance, along with abstract methods 
for deposit and withdrawal. The SavingsAccount class, a subclass of Account, should include 
an additional attribute for interest rate and override the deposit method to calculate interest, as 
well as override the withdrawal method to ensure a sufficient balance. Similarly, the 
CurrentAccount class, also a subclass of Account, should incorporate an overdraft limit 
attribute and override the withdrawal method to check the overdraft limit. Implement the 
classes as described, ensuring proper encapsulation and abstraction. Finally, create a 
BankingApplication class (Main) to demonstrate the polymorphic behavior by creating 
instances of both SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount, testing deposit and withdrawal 
operations, and displaying account details


    abstract class  Account{
    private int accountNumber;
    private int balance;

    public void setbalance(int balance){
        this.balance=balance;
    }
    public int getbalance(){
        return balance;
    }
        abstract void deposite();
        abstract void withdrawl();
    }
    class SavingsAccount extends Account{
    int interest_rate;
    public void setInterest_rate(int  interest_rate){
        this.interest_rate=interest_rate;
    }
    void deposite(){
        int interest=getbalance()*interest_rate/100;
        System.out.println("The interest deposited is "+ interest );
    }
    void withdrawl(){
        System.out.println("withdraw amount is " +interest_rate);
    }

    }
    class  CurrentAccount extends  Account{
    int  overdraft_limit;
        public void setOverdraft_limit(int  overdraft_limit){
            this.overdraft_limit=overdraft_limit;
        }
        void deposite(){
            int interest=getbalance()*overdraft_limit;
            System.out.println("The amount deposited is "+interest );
        }
        void withdrawl(){
            System.out.println("withdraw amount is " +overdraft_limit);
        }

    }
    public class AssignmentQ7 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    SavingsAccount sa=new SavingsAccount();
    CurrentAccount ca=new CurrentAccount();
    sa.setbalance(20000);
    sa.setInterest_rate(6);
    ca.setbalance(290000);
    ca.setOverdraft_limit(5);
    sa.deposite();
    sa.withdrawl();
    ca.deposite();
    ca.withdrawl();
    }
}



//output
The interest deposited is 1200
withdraw amount is 6
The amount deposited is 1450000
withdraw amount is 5
