Q8. Write a Java program that illustrates the concepts of interfaces, method overriding, and 
method overloading. Begin by defining an interface named Vehicle with two abstract methods: 
accelerate() and brake(). Then, create two classes, Car and Bicycle, both of which implement 
the Vehicle interface. In the Car class, override the accelerate() and brake() methods to print 
appropriate messages indicating the acceleration and braking actions for a car. Similarly, in the 
Bicycle class, override the same methods to display messages specific to a bicycle's 
acceleration and braking. Additionally, implement method overloading in both classes by 
providing multiple versions of the accelerate() method, each accepting different parameters 
such as speed and duration. Finally, create a Main class to instantiate objects of both Car and 
Bicycle classes, test their overridden methods, and demonstrate method overloading by 
invoking different versions of the accelerate() method


interface vechile{
    void accelerate();
    void brake();
}
class cars implements vechile{
    public void accelerate(){
        System.out.println("accelerating the car");
    }
    void accelerate(int duration){
        System.out.println("car runing for the duration "+duration +" hours");
    }
    public void brake(){
        System.out.println("applying break in car");
    }
}
class bicycle implements vechile{
    public void accelerate(){
        System.out.println("accelerating the bicycle");
    }
     void accelerate(int speed){
         System.out.println("The speed of the bicycle is "+ speed);
     }
    public void brake(){
        System.out.println("applying break in cycle");
    }
}
public class AssignmentQ8 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    cars c=new cars();
    c.accelerate();
    c.accelerate(5);
    c.brake();
    bicycle by=new bicycle();
    by.accelerate();
    by.accelerate(50);
    by.brake();
    }
}



//output
accelerating the car
car runing for the duration 5 hours
applying break in car
accelerating the bicycle
The speed of the bicycle is 50
applying break in cycle
