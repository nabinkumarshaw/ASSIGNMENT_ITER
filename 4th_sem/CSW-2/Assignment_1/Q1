Q1. Write a program to create a bank account application and perform basic
operations like withdraw and deposit.
Note:
– In the above question explain how to design the problem using objectoriented approaches.
– In the design part pictorially represent to class Account and BankApp
and the respective variable and methods
– Explain encapsulation by making data member private and member
functions public
– Use the set, and get methods
– Explain how to override the toString method with proper annotation.
– Then implement it using Java


//code
package Assignment_1;
class account {
    private double balance;
    public account(double balance) {
        balance = balance;
    }
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance = balance +amount;
            System.out.println(amount + " deposited successfully.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid amount for deposit.");
        }
    }
    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
            balance = balance -amount;
            System.out.println(amount + " withdrawn successfully.");
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient funds or invalid amount for withdrawal.");
        }
    }
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
public class assignment_Q1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        account acc = new account(1000);
        acc.deposit(500);
        acc.withdraw(200);
        acc.withdraw(2000);
    }
}



//output
500.0 deposited successfully.
200.0 withdrawn successfully.
Insufficient funds or invalid amount for withdrawal.
