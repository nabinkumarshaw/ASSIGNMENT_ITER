Q2. Develop a Java program showcasing reference reassignment and garbage collection using 
the ReassigningReference class. This class features a constructor initializing an object with a 
given name. In the main() method, two instances of ReassigningReference are created. Then, 
the reference is reassigned. Subsequently, the garbage collector is explicitly invoked. 
Additionally, the program overrides the finalize() method to print the name of the object upon 
successful garbage collection.

//code
public class Q02 {

    private String name;

    public Q02(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    protected void finalize() {
        System.out.println("Garbage collected: " + name);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Q02 obj1 = new Q02("Object1");
        Q02 obj2 = new Q02("Object2");

        obj1 = null;
        obj2 = null;

        System.gc();
    }
}

/**
 * OUTPUT
 *
 * Garbage collected: Object2
 */
