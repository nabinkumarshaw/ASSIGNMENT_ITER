Q3) . Write a Java program illustrating nullification of references and garbage collection using 
the NullifiedReference class. This class comprises a constructor initializing an object with a 
provided name. Within the main() method, an instance of NullifiedReference is created and 
assigned, followed by a nullification of the object reference. Subsequently, the garbage 
collector is explicitly invoked. Furthermore, the program overrides the finalize() method to 
print the name of the object upon successful garbage collection.

//code
public class Q03 {

    private String name;

    public Q03(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    protected void finalize() {
        System.out.println("Garbage collected: " + name);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Q03 obj = new Q03("Object");

        obj = null;

        System.gc();
    }
}

/**
 * OUTPUT
 *
 * Garbage collected: Object
