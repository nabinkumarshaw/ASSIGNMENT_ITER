1.	Create and Write to a File: Write a Java program that prompts the user for a diary entry, then creates a file named "diary.txt" and writes 
the current date followed by the user's entry into this file. Ensure the program checks if the file already exists and informs the user, 
to avoid overwriting any previous content

//code
package File_Management;

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Q1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter your diary entry:");
        String entry = sc.nextLine();

        // Create a file object for diary.txt
        File myfile = new File("diary.txt");

        try{
            myfile.createNewFile();
        }
        catch(Exception e){
            System.out.println(e);
        }

        // Check if the file already exists
        if (myfile.exists()) {
            System.out.println("The file 'diary.txt' already exists. Your entry will be appended to it.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Creating a new file 'diary.txt'...");
        }
        try {
            FileWriter myfilewriter = new FileWriter("diary.txt");
            myfilewriter.write(entry);
            myfilewriter.close();
            System.out.println("Your entry has been successfully written to the file.");
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e);
        }
        sc.close();
    }
}

//output
Enter your diary entry:
2024 04 20 
The file 'diary.txt' already exists. Your entry will be appended to it.
Your entry has been successfully written to the file.
