6.	Delete a Specific File: Write a Java program where the user can enter the name of a file to be deleted from the system. The program should check 
if the file exists and delete it, providing a confirmation message upon successful deletion or an error message if the file does not exist.

//code
package File_Management;

import java.io.File;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Q6 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Enter the name of the file to delete:");
        String fileName = sc.nextLine();

        // Create a File object for the specified file
        File fileToDelete = new File(fileName);

        // Check if the file exists
        if (!fileToDelete.exists()) {
            System.out.println("The specified file does not exist.");
            System.exit(1);
        }

        // Attempt to delete the file
        if (fileToDelete.delete()) {
            System.out.println("File '" + fileName + "' has been successfully deleted.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Failed to delete the file '" + fileName + "'.");
        }
        sc.close();
    }
}
