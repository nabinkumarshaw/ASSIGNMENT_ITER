3.	Append Content to an Existing File: Write a Java program that adds a new diary entry to the "diary.txt" file without overwriting its existing
content. The program should ask the user for the new entry and append it to the file along with a timestamp

//code
package File_Management;

import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Q3 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter your new diary entry:");
        String newEntry = sc.nextLine();
        try {
            System.getProperty("diary.txt");
            // Create a FileWriter object with append mode to append to the file
            FileWriter myfilewriter = new FileWriter("diary.txt");
             myfilewriter.write(newEntry);
            myfilewriter.close();
            System.out.println("Your new entry has been successfully added to the file.");
        }
        catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred while appending to the file.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
